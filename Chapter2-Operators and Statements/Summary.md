# Summary
<h3>
<p>
This chapter covered a wide variety of topics, including dozens of Java operators, along
with numerous control fl ow statements. Many of these operators and statements may have
been new to you.
It is important that you understand how to use all of the required Java operators covered
in this chapter and know how operator precedence infl uences the way a particular expression
is interpreted. There will likely be numerous questions on the exam that appear to test
one thing, such as StringBuilder or exception handling, when in fact the answer is related
to the misuse of a particular operator that causes the application to fail to compile. 
</p>
<p>When
you see an operator on the exam, always check that the appropriate data types are used and
that they match each other where applicable.
For statements, this chapter covered two types of control structures: decision-making
controls structures, including if-then, if-then-else, and switch statements, as well as
repetition control structures including for, for-each, while, and do-while. Remember that
most of these structures require the evaluation of a particular boolean expression either for
branching decisions or once per repetition. The switch statement is the only one that supports
a variety of data types, including String variables as of Java 7.
With a for-each statement you don’t need to explicitly write a boolean expression, since
the compiler builds them implicitly. For clarity, we referred to an enhanced for loop as a
for-each loop, but syntactically they are written as a for statement.</p>
<p>
We concluded this chapter by discussing advanced control options and how fl ow can be
enhanced through nested loops, break statements, and continue statements. Be wary of
questions on the exam that use nested statements, especially ones with labels, and verify
they are being used correctly.
This chapter is especially important because at least one component of this chapter will
likely appear in every exam question with sample code. Many of the questions on the exam
focus on proper syntactic use of the structures, as they will be a large source of questions
that end in “Does not compile.” You should be able to answer all of the review questions
correctly or fully understand those that you answered incorrectly before moving on to later
chapters.
