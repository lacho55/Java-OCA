# Summary

<p>
In this chapter, you learned that Strings are immutable sequences of characters. The new
operator is optional. The concatenation operator (+) creates a new String with the content
of the fi rst String followed by the content of the second String. If either operand
involved in the + expression is a String, concatenation is used; otherwise, addition is used.
String literals are stored in the string pool. The String class has many methods. You need
to know charAt(), concat(), endsWith(), equals(), equalsIgnoreCase(), indexOf(),
length(), replace(), startsWith(), substring(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), and
trim().

StringBuilders are mutable sequences of characters. Most of the methods return a
reference to the current object to allow method chaining. The StringBuilder class has
many methods. You need to know append(), charAt(), delete(), deleteCharAt(),
indexOf(), insert(), length(), reverse(), substring(), and toString(). StringBuffer
is the same as StringBuilder except that it is thread safe.
Calling == on String objects will check whether they point to the same object in the
pool. Calling == on StringBuilder references will check whether they are pointing to the
same StringBuilder object. Calling equals() on String objects will check whether the
sequence of characters is the same. Calling equals() on StringBuilder objects will check
whether they are pointing to the same object rather than looking at the values inside.

An array is a fi xed-size area of memory on the heap that has space for primitives or
pointers to objects. You specify the size when creating it—for example, int[] a = new
int[6];. Indexes begin with 0 and elements are referred to using a[0]. The Arrays.sort()
method sorts an array. Arrays.binarySearch() searches a sorted array and returns the
index of a match. If no match is found, it negates the position where the element would

need to be inserted and subtracts 1. Methods that are passed varargs (…) can be used as
if a normal array was passed in. In a multidimensional array, the second-level arrays and
beyond can be different sizes.
An ArrayList can change size over its life. It can be stored in an ArrayList or List
reference. Generics can specify the type that goes in the ArrayList. You need to know the
methods add(), clear(), contains(), equals(), isEmpty(), remove(), set(), and size().
</p>
Although an ArrayList is not allowed to contain primitives, Java will autobox parameters
passed in to the proper wrapper type. Collections.sort() sorts an ArrayList.
A LocalDate contains just a date, a LocalTime contains just a time, and a LocalDateTime
contains both a date and time. All three have private constructors and are created using
LocalDate.now() or LocalDate.of() (or the equivalents for that class). Dates and times
can be manipulated using plusXXX or minusXXX methods. The Period class represents a
number of days, months, or years to add or subtract from a LocalDate or LocalDateTime.
DateTimeFormatter is used to output dates and times in the desired format. The date and
time classes are all immutable, which means the return value must be used.
